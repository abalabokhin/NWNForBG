@0 = ~I urge you to keep away from these bodies, my <LADYLORD>. There is a risk of contagion, I understand.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I'll answer what I can. Just keep back from the pile, <SIRMAAM>. Try not to breath the fumes directly... ugh... it's disgusting...~
@4 = ~Aren't you in danger of becoming infected yourself?~
@5 = ~Where are all these dead people coming from?~
@6 = ~This can't be a pleasant task for you.~
@7 = ~I'm investigating the plague. Perhaps you could tell me more about it.~
@8 = ~Can you tell me what's going on in this area?~
@9 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@10 = ~Begone and leave me to my grim task.~
@11 = ~I am. If I fall, I will be far from the first amongst the city guard to do so. All I can ask is that Helm watch over me and protect me from this evil.~
@12 = ~These? These are all plague victims, of course. Many of the fools tried to gain access to the City Core and died at the quarantine gates. Some of them are locals, however. The Wailing Death has come to the core, despite our efforts. I expect things will only get worse before they get better.~
@13 = ~It seems a shame to burn these poor souls, to not even give them a decent burial. We have no choice, however. Ilmater help us, no choice at all.~
@14 = ~Far from it. The Wailing Death has already taken my wife and my only son from me, however. 'Tis not as if it can get any worse, for me. If I catch the plague here, it won't be so bad. At least I'd see my family again. There are other guards that still have folks to live for.~
@15 = ~Everyone knows something about the plague. Half of it isn't true and the other half is rumor. I'm not sure I can add much to it all.~
@16 = ~What can you tell me about the plague?~
@17 = ~Have you heard anything about strange animals in the area?~
@18 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@19 = ~The Wailing Death is going on, fool. Ahhh, don't mind me, <SIRMAAM>. The core is no place for any sane man to be these days.~
@20 = ~I am not from this district. Nor would I be inclined to point your way, <SIRMAAM>, even if I were. Ask someone else for aid.~
@21 = ~¿Además de lo obvio? Parece que los dioses no pueden curar la Muerte Llorosa. Ninguna de las bendiciones de esos clérigos sirve de nada. Te hace pensar que quizá los dioses nos han abandonado, ¿verdad? Te hace pensar que viene algo peor. Incluso te hace pensar que se acerca el invierno. ¿Necesitas algo más, entonces? ~
@22 = ~¿Animales? Me suena. Oí algo sobre la llegada de unos animales de Aguas Profundas, pero nada más. Sin duda, es algo que preocupa a los demás guardias de la ciudad. En esta publicación, no me cuentan mucho. ~
@23 = ~¿Entonces no has oído hablar de ningún animal en esta zona?~
@24 = ~¿Qué quieres saber?~
@25 = ~*Suspiro* Mira lo que hago, <SIRMAAM>. Muy poca gente se atreve a hablar conmigo largo y tendido, si es que lo hace. Quizás tengas más suerte preguntando estas cosas en una taberna. ¿Hay algo más que quieras entonces? ~
@26 = ~Apártate. Estos cuerpos portan la peste.~
