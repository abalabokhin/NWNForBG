@0 = ~NP: Э? I suppose you're here to join our ranks, aren't you? However, I don't have time for new students right now, so get out.~ [KENDR056] /*Eh? I suppose you're here to sign up, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, are ye? I've no time for a new apprentice, however, so off ye go.*/
@1 = ~Sign up for what?~
@2 = ~I'm not here to apprentice for anything.~
@3 = ~Bite your tongue, old man.~
@4 = ~Are you sure? I'd really like to sign up.~
@5 = ~For the bloody mercenary guild, of course. Isn't that why ye've come? Hmmm... unless ye're not here for training.~
@6 = ~Nay? Then what's a young wit like yerself come to the guild for? Ye on official business?~
@7 = ~Hah! Ye've got a bit o' venom, I'll grant ye that. It won't get ye into the guild any quicker, though.~
@8 = ~Aye? Young wits like yerself who want t' join the guild are a copper fer a dozen, these days... though ye does looks in good shape, there.~
@9 = ~NP: Wait a minute. now I know who you are. You're the company that came here with Lady Aribeth, aren't you? Neverwinter? I apologize. After all, there's been a lot of strangers coming through our town lately. Is there anything I can do for you?~ /*Wait... now I've placed ye. Ye're one o' the folk who came with the Lady Aribeth, aren't ye? From Neverwinter?*/
@10 = ~Who are you?~
@11 = ~What kind of guild is this?~
@12 = ~I have one of the ears.~
@13 = ~I'd like to ask some questions.~
@14 = ~I need some directions.~
@15 = ~I will leave.~
@16 = ~Me name be Kendrack, head of the guild, here, and mayor of Port Llast. Also known as the First Captain. Yer name be, then... ?~
@17 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@18 = ~Pleased to meet you. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@19 = ~NP: My name means nothing. <CHARNAME> leads our team.~ /*Me name be <CHARNAME>. It be nice to meet you.*/
@20 = ~You don't need to know who I am.~
@21 = ~NP: Yeah, I seem to recall the Lady mentioning you. She said you're kind of heroes, actually. so I'm doubly glad to see you here. I have a problem that someone with your kind of experience could help me with... and make some money on top of it. Interested?~ /*Aye, I think I recall the Lady mentioning ye now. She said ye be a hero, in fact... which makes me doubly glad ye're here.*/
@22 = ~What's the problem?~
@23 = ~If the reward's right.~
@24 = ~No, I'm not interested.~
@25 = ~NP: You're a sneaky little thing, aren't you? Yeah, well. I think the lady said something about you. Hero, she did, and I guess I should be glad you're here. I got a problem that someone with your experience could help me with. and you'll make some extra money. Interested?~ /*The mysterious type, are ye? No need... I seem to recall the Lady mentioning ye. A hero, she said, an' perhaps I should be glad ye're here.*/
@26 = ~NP: Not long ago I received word from Waterdeep that a group of criminals had escaped from Bastion. A dangerous gang, all murderers. The report said the group may have split up to make it harder to catch... but they're all somewhere in this neighborhood. That worries me, and it worries me bad. There's a big bounty on each one of them. You have to bring the left ear with the Bastion branding to prove they're all dead.~ /*According to the word, the group be split up to avoid capture... but all of them be in this region. That makes me nervous, it does.*/
@27 = ~NP: It's too dangerous a task to send my own men on. but maybe you're up to it. What do you think?~ /*'Tis too dangerous a task to set me own men to it... but perhaps ye might be up to the challenge. What does ye think, <PRO_GIRLBOY>?*/
@28 = ~How much are the bounties?~
@29 = ~Just how dangerous are these men?~
@30 = ~So I would have to bring back their ear?~
@31 = ~Yes, I'll do it.~
@32 = ~Kendrack, head of the mercenary guild and Mayor of Port Llast, has put out a reward for the death of five dangerous prisoners escaped from Waterdeep. They have separated to avoid detection but can all be identified by means of a tattoo on their left ear, marking them as inmates of the Bulwark prison. It is this tattoo that Kendrack wants as evidence of the deed.
Zor, a burly minotaur, is rumored to have been spotted on the north road, near the Green Griffon Inn. Wyvern, an elven ranger with a taste for trickery, will likely have sought refuge in the Neverwinter Wood. Stirge, an egomaniacal gnome, was last sighted on the road south of Port Llast. Delilah, a halfling assassin who once made her home in Luskan, was last seen on the road east of Port Llast. Yesgar, the group's ring-leader and mastermind, remains elusive though Kendrack doubts that he'd stray far.~
@33 = ~There be five criminals escaped, and a bounty of 300 gold pieces exists for each of them.~
@34 = ~Not all be men, in fact... but all be quite deadly. If ye finds them, be careful. At least they be separated, now, and not all together.~
@35 = ~Aye. They be not wanted alive, any longer. The seal of the prison on their ear identifies them... and it be easier than carryin' the body.~
@36 = ~NP: That's a relief to hear. As long as they're alive and on the loose, those thugs will be trouble, obviously. I hope you find them all. The names of these five are: Zor, Stirge, Wyvern, Dalila and Ezgar.~ /*T'is a relief to hear that, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. If left free an' alive, these criminals would become a problem, I am sure. I hope ye finds them all.*/
@37 = ~Tell me about Zor.~
@38 = ~Tell me about the Stirge.~
@39 = ~Tell me about Wyvern.~
@40 = ~Tell me about Delilah.~
@41 = ~Tell me about Yesgar.~
@42 = ~NP: That's a shame. I thought we'd get this one out of the way sooner. Let me know if you change your mind.~ /*That be too bad. 'Tis a bit of a worry for me that I'd like t' see resolved soon. Let me know if ye change yer mind, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
@43 = ~NP: Zor is a minotaur, so this one will stand out wherever he goes. He's a strong and fierce warrior. except he's a little on the small side. I'm told he still has many friends in Luskan. Perhaps he'll be there, or at least try to infiltrate the city.~ /*Zor be a minotaur, so he should stick out wherever he goes. He be strong and a fierce warrior... but is a wee bit simple in the head.*/
@44 = ~NP: Stirge is a strange sort. A dwarf thief, they say, who believes he is smarter than anyone else living on earth. This dwarf was last seen in the uninhabited lands along the South Road, though he can hide anywhere there.~ /*The gnome were sighted last in the wildlands along the South Road, though he could be anywhere there.*/
@45 = ~NP: Wyvern is an elf, male, a notorious bandit, and a great expert in the forest. He is deceitful and cunning, and good with a bow. The elf has not been seen, but I think it is almost certain that he is hiding in the Neverwinter Forest. So the best place to look for him is there.~ /*The elf has not been sighted, but I have little doubt he be hidden within the Neverwinter Wood. Best search for him there.*/
@46 = ~NP: A halfling woman known for her cruelty and viciousness. She's an assassin from Luskan. I've heard, however, that the city is locked down, so it's unlikely she's there. The last I heard of her, she was seen east of the city, and then she seemed to disappear.~ /*I hear the city be closed up tight, however, so I doubt she'll be there. Last word I have of that one is that she was spotted east of town, and then all but vanished.*/
@47 = ~NP: Yezgar is a ferocious half-orc killer, and it was he who planned the escape of all these criminals. Of all the escapees, Yezgar remains the most elusive. I have no idea where he might be. although it's unlikely he'll get very far.~ /*Of all the ones that have escaped, 'tis Yesgar who has remained the most elusive. I have not a clue where he might be... though he will not stray far.*/
@48 = ~This be the mercenary guild. Here I train fighters to hone their skills, and we see to hiring them out.~
@49 = ~Can you train me?~
@50 = ~Do you sell arms and armor, then?~
@51 = ~Let me ask you something else.~
@52 = ~NP: You won't learn much in such a short time, and besides, like I said, the guild is full of people.~ /*In such a short time, it would benefit ye little, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. An' besides, as I already said, the guild be full.*/
@53 = ~Nay. If ye wishes such, go an' speak to Haljal at the Cracked Anvil. He would have all ye need, I assure ye.~
@54 = ~Aye, of course.~
@55 = ~Aye? Ye found one of the convicts? Which ear do ye have there?~
@56 = ~NP: I have Zora's ear.~ /*Me got questions me want ask.*/
@57 = ~NP: I have Stirge's ear.~ /*I have a question.*/
@58 = ~NP: I have Wyvern's ear.~ /*I have a question.*/
@59 = ~NP: I have Dalila's Ear.~ /*Me gots stuff from one of the tomb-things.*/
@60 = ~Oops, me no have nothin'.~
@61 = ~NP: Yeah. In fact, those tags the guy from Bastion told me about. Congratulations, that's a big favor for all of us. So I'll be happy to offer a reward. Come back when you catch more bandits.~ /*Aye. 'Tis indeed the markings that the men of the Bulwark told me of. Congratulations, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, ye've done a service fer us all.*/
@62 = ~NP: Well, I hope you find those bastards soon.~ /*I certainly hope that you find Samuel soon.*/
@63 = ~Aye, I'm sure I can tell ye what ye need to know.~
@64 = ~What have you heard about the plague in Neverwinter?~
@65 = ~Do you know of anything odd in the area?~
@66 = ~I'm looking for work, if you know of any.~
@67 = ~I have some questions about the bounties.~
@68 = ~I'm sure ye do. What do ye need t' know?~
@69 = ~NP: All I know is that it's over. Well, the news made our hearts feel better... people were afraid that the plague would spread to us.~ /*Only that it be over, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. A mighty relief that news was, as well... folk were terrified that the plague would spread to town.*/
@70 = ~NP: Yeah, there's all sorts of weird stuff reported here. Beasts are atrocious, bandits walking around like they're at home, that sort of thing. It's weird as hell. I guess I should have expected it, though. there's not enough people in Neverwinter or Luskan to patrol now, is there?~ /*It is most strange. I suppose maybe it's to be expected, though... neither Neverwinter nor Luskan has the manpower for patrols right now, aye?*/
@71 = ~If ye're askin' about odd things in Port Llast, hmmm... maybe ye should speak to Nuirek at the temple. I hear the cleric has grave worries as o' late.~
@72 = ~I have a problem someone competent like yerself might be able to help with... an' there's coin in it for ye, to boot. Might ye be interested?~
@73 = ~I know Port Llast well. Ask away.~
@74 = ~Is there a good inn nearby?~
@75 = ~Is there a decent store in town?~
@76 = ~What temples are nearby?~
@77 = ~NP: Are there any druids in the area?~ /*Is there a druid grove in the area?*/
@78 = ~Me asks something else.~
@79 = ~NP: Yep. 'The Union Emblem' is a lovely tavern, and you'll meet other adventurers there this time of year. You want to find something else?~ /*Aye. The Alliance Arms is a fine inn, and ye'll find other adventurers like yerself there, this time o' year.*/
@80 = ~NP: Halyal's 'Cracked Anvil' has just about everything you need. You want to find something else?~ /*Haljal at the Cracked Anvil should have just about everything ye need, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
@81 = ~NP: The only temple in town is the Temple of Tyre, run by Father Newrick. You want to find something else?~ /*The only temple in town is Tyr's, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Your Lady Aribeth be there, as is Father Neurik.*/
@82 = ~NP: There's a grove in Neverwinter Forest, yeah. You should talk to Ballard about it. you'll find him in a little grove northeast of the city walls. You want to find something else?~ /*There be one off in the Neverwinter Wood, aye. Ye may wish to speak to Ballard about it... ye'll find him at his little grove just outside o' town.*/
@83 = ~NP: Good luck on your wanderings, hero.~ /*I wish ye the best o' luck on yer quest, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
@84 = ~NP: Uh, good afternoon? Is there anything I can do for you? Do you have any business in the guild?~ [KENDR057] /*Aye, <PRO_GIRLBOY>? Something I can do for ye? Has ye business with the guild?*/
@85 = ~NP: It's good to see you again, <LADYLORD>. Did you manage to track down the fugitives?~ [KENDR058] /*'Tis good to see ye again, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Have ye had any luck tracking down the bounties?*/
@86 = ~NP: Thank the gods for your return! While you were away in Port Llast, that half-orc demon, Ezgar, kidnapped my Shaldrisse! He demanded a ransom for her return, and he was paid! But he still hasn't brought her back! Please, I beg you... bring back my Shaldrisse! She is my only child!~ [KENDR055] /*He demanded a ransom for her return, and it was paid! But still he did not return her! Please, I beg of ye... get my Shaldrissa back! She is my only child!*/
@87 = ~Why don't you and your men get her back?~
@88 = ~Do you know where she's being held?~
@89 = ~And what might my reward be for doing that?~
@90 = ~Very well. I'll do it.~
@91 = ~No. Not interested.~
@92 = ~I... I could not endanger my daughter, and I would not trust me men to do it, if the truth be told. You, however, are a powerful <PRO_MANWOMAN> who has done so much... I would trust you. You may be her only hope!~
@93 = ~NP: Yeah, I know. The old Port Llast mines north of town, by the Green Gryphon Tavern. That's where he keeps it, I'm sure. The place is treacherous and easily defended, so I dare not approach. I can only hope you know something I don't.~ /*It is a treacherous place, and easy to defend, which is why I dare not approach. I can only hope ye have the skills I don't.*/
@94 = ~Reward? Ye can keep the ransom, if he has it. Just get her back safe, I beg ye!~
@95 = ~NP: Then go to the old mines by the 'Green Gryphon' tavern, north of the city. Hurry, <LADYLORD>, hurry! Oh yeah, I almost forgot, here's your reward for the bandits' ears.~ /*Go to the old mines by the Green Griffon Inn to the north of town, then. They are locked and you shall need this key. Hurry, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, hurry!*/
@96 = ~NP: Port Llast: Bounty hunting.

We've been looking everywhere for prisoners who escaped from Bastion Prison. Four of the five ears were delivered to Mayor Kendrak, but almost simultaneously Port Llast was rocked by terrible news. The criminal Yezgar has kidnapped Kendrak's daughter, Shaldrisse, and taken her to the abandoned mines near the Green Gryphon Tavern. The mayor pleads to save her.~ /*Adventurers have been tightening the noose around the necks of the escaped convicts from Bulwark prison. Four of the five ears have been returned to Mayor Kendrack but terrible news has struck the town of Port Llast all the same. Kendrack's daughter, Shaldrissa, has been kidnapped by the criminal Yesgar and taken to the abandoned mines near the Green Griffon Inn. Mayor has begged for her rescue and provided the key that will be needed to gain entrance to the mines.*/
@97 = ~NP: Я... I guess you can't be blamed. It's very dangerous. Here's the rest of the reward for the ears. I beg you to reconsider and save her. Shaldrissa is reckless and impatient, but in her youth. she didn't deserve to die at the hands of an assassin.~ /*I beg ye to change yer mind and find her. Shaldrissa is hot-headed and impetuous because she is young... she doesn't deserve this fate at the hands of a murderer.*/
@98 = ~NP: Have you changed your mind? Please, I pray you... bring back my Shaldress! She's my only child!~ /*You are dead. Please load a saved game or exit.*/
@99 = ~NP: Then go to the old mines at the Green Gryphon Tavern, north of town. Hurry, my friend, hurry!~ /*Go to the old mines by the Green Griffon Inn to the north of town, then. They are locked and you shall need this key. Hurry, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, hurry!*/
@100 = ~What is the word? Have you found my daughter? Is she safe?!~ [KENDR054]
@101 = ~Tell me what happened again.~
@102 = ~Where do I find her?~
@103 = ~I'm sorry, Kendrack... but Shaldrissa died. I tried my best.~
@104 = ~I'll go look for her now.~
@105 = ~Find her yourself. I have other problems.~
@106 = ~NP: The last of these escaped prisoners, that bloodthirsty half-orc Ezgar... he kidnapped my only daughter, Shaldrisse. I've already paid the ransom he demanded... but he still hasn't returned her. I fear for her life! Please, I beg you, save her!~ /*I already paid the ransom he demanded... but still he has not returned her. I fear for her life! Please, I beg ye to save her!*/
@107 = ~I be sure she's held at the old mines. Ye can find them north of town, near the Green Griffon Inn.~
@108 = ~NP: Dead? But, uh. but how could she die? Of course you did it! Ugh! I can't believe I trusted you! My Shaldrissa is dead!!!~ /*Ye killed her yerself, no doubt! Bah! I cannot believe I trusted ye! My Shaldrissa... dead!!*/
@109 = ~Adventurers have been tightening the noose around the necks of the escaped convicts from Bulwark prison.

Kendrack's daughter, Shaldrissa, had been kidnapped by the criminal Yesgar and taken to the abandoned mines near the Green Griffon Inn. Mayor Kendrack begged for her rescue and, while she was found, she was unfortunately killed in the attempted escape.~

@111 = ~Go on, then. Leave the poor lass to die, heartless wretch!~
@112 = ~NP: Leave me alone, <MALEFEMALE>. We have nothing to talk about.~ [KENDR051] /*Leave me be, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. We have nothing to talk about.*/
@113 = ~Get away from me! Some hero ye are... my Shaldrissa lies dead because of ye!~ [KENDR052]
@114 = ~NP: Shaldrissa has been rescued and is back! I can't tell you how grateful I am! You are truly a hero, just as Mistress said! The girl is shaken up, but otherwise fine. Well, maybe this will temper her adventurous nature, eh?~ [KENDR053] /*Shaldrissa is safe and returned! I cannot thank ye enough! Ye truly are the hero the Lady told me of!*/
@115 = ~NP: Here, take the reward for Ezgar. I wish I had more to reward you with. If the ransom is found, keep it... and as for whatever tasks the Lady has given you, I wish you great luck.~ /*I wish I had more to reward ye with.
