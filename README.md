General Information:
------------

The mod repeats, with some minor modifications, the plot of Neverwinter Nights game. Once Gorion's Ward reaches the experience of 1350000 XP, he/she can start Neverwinter Nights. At this moment, a messenger from Neverwinter will approach him/her in any of the Athkatla's Districts and ask for help. However, recommended amount of XP to start NWN content is 1750000.

There are three components in this mod:
1. Main component, that install all the resources for the mod.
2. Map component, for EET for BG2EE you can select between using map icons with BP-BGT-Worldmap or using a dedicated map for NWN content. For BGT and oBG2 icons for BG-BGT-Worldmap are used.
3. Install NWNForBG as a didicated campaign (for BG2EE and EET only) depending on the second component the appropriate map will be used. For EET, NWN is added to the list of campaigns, for BG2EE, UI is modified (ATTENTION: this was not tested with different UI mods for BG2EE). PC starts the dedicated campaign with 1.5M XP and about 10K GP.

Mods which extend material presented here are welcome as separate modifications, with the appropriate credit given to the authors. If you want something to become a direct part of this mod, you will need to contact AGKanevchev and/or paladin84.

Compatibility
-------------

- Neverwinter Nights for Baldur's Gate should be fully compatible with BG2:TOB, BGT, BG2EE, EET games and with pretty much any other mod that's out there. All bg2 events are blocked while you are doing NWN content, so don't be afraid that Jaheira's personal quest will be broken. 
- Also, some of the new wizard spells (eg Icelance) might have conflicts with some Talents of Faerûn mod components as for Beta 3 version if Talents of Faerûn is installed after NWNForBG.
- This mod also pathes some existing spells, so any mod that replaces spells entirely (eg Spell Revisions mod main component) should be installed prior Neverwinter Nights for Baldur's Gate. 
- If there are any of new wizard spells (eg Icelance) already installed in the game (eg from IWDification), only new unique spells are going to be installed and previously installed version of already existing spells are going to be used. Thus, if you want to use spells from IWDification, install NWNForBG after IWDification or rewrite existing spells with IWDifications if it is installed after NWNForBG. If IWDification spells are used there are also should not be any issues with Talents of Faerûn (not tested).
- If there are UI mods that change BG2EE starting screen dramatically, installing third compoment with BG2EE might not add NWN campaign propeprly (UI mods were not tested with third component of the mod, installed on BG2EE), but everything should work with EET.

Installation
-------------

Copy mod into BG2:TOB, BGT, BG2EE or EET folder and run setup-NWNForBG.exe.

Dependencies
-------------

<h3>For BG2:TOB and BGT:</h3>

Make sure ToBex (or other mods, increasing maximum number of music), Baldur's Gate II Fixpack and Infinity-Animations (there can be a problem with code page for non-English window systems, be careful, read README and [here](https://www.gibberlings3.net/forums/topic/37297-bg2-crashes-due-to-some-mod/).) are installed prior to Neverwinter Nights for Baldur's Gate. BP-BGT-Worldmap v13.0 or later must be installed after Neverwinter Nights for Baldur's Gate. It is highly recommened to install generalized\_biffing (latest version, works with the latest weidu) after Neverwinter Nights for Baldur's Gate.

<h3>For BG2EE and EET:</h3>

Depending on second component of the mod, BP-BGT-Worldmap v13.0 or later might need to be installed after Neverwinter Nights for Baldur's Gate. For mods that add other campaigns to EET (eg IWD\_EET\_Integration), third component of this mod should be installed after them.

Translator Notes:
----------------
Russian, English, Spanish and Chinese languages are pretty much done, but any corrections are always welcome.
Other languages are mixed English and other language lines (eg French and English). For every line on English,
the "closest" line(s) in the language (eg French) from the original NWN texts is shown in comments. Often,
the original NWN lines were changed in English and should be change in the other language respectively. For
the new lines, what in comments is usually garbage, so just translate them. After correcting/translating the
line, the comment should be removed. It is easy to find all the lines that needs to be corrected by searching
open comments string (without quotes): "/*".

What else needs to be done:

1. Pay extra attention to the gold amount in the texts, it was changes (compared to original NWN texts) everywhere.
2. Translate files worlmap.tra and CheatAreas.tra manually.
3. Verify with the original NWN texts if necessary, they are located in eg "NWNForBG/reference/bash\_scripts/entries\_fr.txt.tra".
4. Fix lines @1 and @2 in setup.tra file to match "Usable by" lines in items description, so they can be
   removed automatically for EE games (see details in NWNForBG/tra/TranslatorNoteItemDescription).
5. All the items in install.tra should be properly translated (for some of them there is a desriptions in original NWN texts,
   but not for many).
6. In install.tra file, there are many names that are combined First and Last name from the original NWN texts.
7. In install.tra file, there are many journal entries, add empty line after the title (see how it is done in
   English).
8. If there is a difference for BG2EE/EET line in install.tra file (to compare woth oBG/BGT lines) that cannot be solved by removing 
   "Usable by", add such lines in install-ee.tra file.
9. If you have any questions, feel free to ask on the support forums.
10. Try to fix all low intellect dialog options, they are in the texts by mistake. In English they look like "me go".
11. Fix @105718 in install.tra - the description was changed compared to the original NWN games. Two stones must be set in each of primary color pools (see how it is in English or Russian).

Known Bugs:

- In fight with Intellect devourer after its current body destroyed and while it in the process of going to a new body if this new body is destroyed or convinced to leave, the Intellect devourer dissapear.
